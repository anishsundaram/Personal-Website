          <p id="about-text">  
          Hello! I am Anish Sundaram, a 2nd year at the University of Michigan majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics and German. I am a passionate self-taught software engineer and I am always interested in learning new things and meeting new people.
        </p>
        
        <p id="about-text">
          My main interests are in Networking Engineering and Full-stack development. To this end I spend a lot of my time learning new skills, building websites like this one, and uploading projects to my <a href="https://github.com/anishsundaram"target="_blank" style="color: crimson;">GitHub Profile</a>.
        </p>

        <p id="about-text">
           On a technical level, I can work with a variety of technologies, both front end and back end. I specialize in C++ but also enjoy using Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL databases to create projects. I also have experience using React.JS and I am currently working on getting better in Go and Angular.
        </p>

        <p id="about-text">
             I am always looking for an opportunity to work on a project and apply my skills to solving real-world problems. Feel free to message me using the contact form below! <a href="rsc/Resume.pdf"target="_blank" style="color: crimson;">View Resume</a>

      <section id="education">
        <div class="about-text-container">

          <p id="about-text">
            I have taken the flagship CS courses at the UofM EECS 280 and 281 and am currently working on becoming an instructors assistent for the latter. In order to learn more about my interests I took web-related classes such as EECS 485-Web Systems and EECS 388-Information Security to learn how to build complex and secure websites. In future terms I hope to learn more about network engineering and information retrieval, but until they become available at Michigan I plan on spend my time pursuing other topics like Machine Learning and Data Science. 
          </p>

          <p id="about-text">
            Aside from programming, I am also interested in Statistics and learning foreign languages, as demonstrated by my 2 minors. Though it might seem to be a strange combination I think this combination of studies demonstrates my interests quite well. I saw the power of statistics and data and how it can be used to inform and mislead, and I realized becoming knowledge in understanding how to interpret trends and data would never be useless. As for German, I have always been interested in learnign more languages and investigating other cultures, and I plan to take classes in Chinese as well if I can!

      <section id="philosophy">
        <div class="about-text-container">
      
          <p id="about-text">
                I love learning: about people, about places, about events, and especially about random facts that I can share with
                others. Maybe it was my fascination with wheel of fortune and Jeopardy growing up but I have always loved reading up on
                new topics and exploring Wikipedia rabbit holes on topics with no relation to my daily life or occupation. In school, I
                let this interest flourish in quizbowl and I still go to bars now and participate in trivia nights. It makes me happy
                and I love this part of myself.
                Besides occasionally helping me with my studies, I let this sense of curiosity drive me to new places and topics. I have
                often been able to use this collection of random information to make friends and contribute to conversation, getting my
                foot in the door of opportunities purely based on recognizing a turn of phrase or some random image. Although I know
                there is much for me to learn, having a basic understanding of a wide array of topics, or even better just knowing what
                kind of questions to ask, can be a big help in making connections and interacting with others.
                I think it's important to be aware of the world around you, and to that extent I remain vigilant of global news and
                participate in conversations with people around the world online. In addition, I enjoy sharing this knowledge with
                others as a way of connecting with other people. I think a characteristic I really enjoy in other people is being able
                to converse in a variety of different topics. I see this present in the way that I make friends with a diverse group of
                people from different aspects of my life. I bounce around these groups and I learn from them to the best of my ability.
                Although it can be hard to keep these groups in balance I enjoy this style because I can participate in different
                conversations and experience a wider range of human interactions and relationships.

          <p id="about-text">
           A for experiences, there are a couple I can highlight to describe my technical experience:

           I am currently a Full-stack engineer at a UofM Faculty project called Learning clues, where I work on the frontend and develop Lambda functions on AWS.

           I have previously worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory where I developed a proof-of-concept project integrating MongoDB and ElasticSearch to an existing data archive project, this project was called Mango.

           At michigan I have worked as an intern at the Center for Entrepreneurship and developed a job posting website and conducted student product research interviews. This website is meant to link students looking to join student ventures.

           I was also a member of the Michigan Aeronautical Science Association where I worked as an avionics engineer and project lead. Here I developed a testing suite using Google Test for our C-based firmware code. 

           Going further back to 2019 I was a networking intern at Cisco Systems where I built a python script that ran on cisco hardware and improved connectivity with security systems like Firewalls.

           That summer I was also a researcher on a data science initiative where I lead the creation of a Python-based classifier to determine habitability of expolanest discovered by NASA and Caltech, publishing the resulting paper in the program journal.

      <section id="honors">
        <p id="about-text">
          Before I entered honors I was really struggling to come up with a guideline for my goals before graduating, and I was thinking of different ways I could gain diverse experiences and learn from leaders. I felt the session in Honors where we talked about the different kinds of experiences we can use for our capstone I understood the opportunities available to me and the Sample schedule we were given has proven very useful in identifying what I can/want to do per semester here at the UofM.
